<h2><a name="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>

<h4 class="faq-header">Why was there no vote?</h4>

<p>After having to cancel EuRuKo 2014 last year we thought about running an online vote, but the truth is — it turned out to be really difficult to build a fair system in time. There would be many grey areas (eligibility of ticket holders vs non ticket-holders, for example) that we would have had to have dealt with.</p>
<p>Historically, teams presented their cities during the conference. With online voting you also wouldn't get the chance to get to know the team and the people behind the next year's conference personally.</p>


<h4 class="faq-header">Who's organising EuRuKo 2015?</h4>

<p>EuRuKo 2015 is organised by the Ukrainian-based EuRuKo 2014 team (Vlad, Natalia, and Julia) with support from other European Ruby associations, including Ruby Berlin e.V. (the organisers of EuRuKo 2011 and eurucamp).</p>

<h4 class="faq-header">Why Salzburg, Austria?</h4>

<p>As you probably remember, we've had to cancel EuRuKo 2014 in Kiev because we couldn't guarantee safety to all and every attendee, which is still the case.</p>
<p>We evaluated five beautiful cities and Salzburg won the vote. We think that it's a great choice for a conference like EuRuKo and just a fantastic place to spend some time at.</p>

<h4 class="faq-header">When Call for Papers will be open?</h4>

<p>We're going to open Call for Papers in March. We are going to try something new, so stay tuned!</p>

<h4 class="faq-header">Will there be a Code of Conduct?</h4>

<p>Yes.</p>
